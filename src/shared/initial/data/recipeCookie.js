  instructions: [
    "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Add quinoa flour to a large baking pan. Bake quinoa flour for 9-10 minutes. This is known as 'toasting' the quinoa flour and will help get rid of any bitterness. Once done toasting, transfer quinoa flour to a bowl to cool off for 5 minutes. Keep heat in oven.",
    "In the large bowl, whisk together quinoa flour, baking soda, and salt; set aside.",
    "In a separate large bowl, mix together melted and cooled coconut oil and brown sugar until smooth. Add in eggs and vanilla and beat again until smooth and creamy.",
    "Add in dry ingredients and mix together until combined and a dough forms. Fold in chocolate chips or chocolate chunks.",
    "Roll dough into 1 inch balls and place on cookie sheet leaving 2 inches apart. Bake 8-11 minutes or until edges just being to turn a golden brown. Do not over bake; we donâ€™t want crispy cookies here! If you noticed that your cookies are baking super flat, then you may want to chill your dough for 10-20 minutes.",
    "Remove from oven and let cool at least 5 minutes on baking sheet. The cookies will need to set and will be a little fragile at first so you have to be a little patient for the edges to harden a bit before removing them. ",
    "Once the edges and bottom harden a bit, transfer to wire rack to finish cooling. Makes 20 cookies, feel free to double the recipe if you want more.",
