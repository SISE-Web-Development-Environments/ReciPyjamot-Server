  instructions: [
    "Put the flour, salt, yeast and fenugreek into the bowl of a mixer, add 3 3/4 cups water, and mix thoroughly until there are no lumps. Alternately, this can be done by hand.",
    "Cover the batter and let rise until approximately doubled in volume. It should look bubbly and frothy on top once risen. This could take anywhere from 1 hour to several hours, depending on the temperature.",
    "The batter, now bubbly, will be gelatinous in texture and not free-flowing. Pour the final 1/4 cup water into the batter, and give several thorough stirs — it should be more free-flowing thanks in part to the extra water, but you don’t want to beat out the bubbles altogether, since they’re responsible for giving the lahoh its texture. If using a stand mixer, turn on the mixer for no more than 10 seconds.",
    "Let sit for another 15 minutes so that the batter rises a bit more. This isn’t 100% necessary, but I found it often gives me better results in case I overworked the batter in the previous step. By the time you start cooking the lahoh, the batter should appear full of tiny little bubbles.",
    "Put your pan on a high flame. When a few drops of water flicked into the pan ball up and dance on the metal surface, you’re ready to go. Remove the pan from the flame and hold the bottom of the pan under a stream of water for several seconds, until the steam and sizzling is less violent (don’t get water into the pan itself — just onto the bottom side). Alternately, you could use a bucket of water to cool the bottom of the pan between lahoh. If you don’t cool the pan, the lahoh will start cooking too quickly and the bottom surface will be full of bubbles as well.",
    "Wipe the inside of the somewhat-cooler pan with the stick of margarine (you could use an oil-soaked paper towel instead, but I’ve had less luck with that). Pour two ladles (or one 12-ounce/360-ml cup) of batter into the pan, trying your best to distribute the batter while pouring. Give the pan a few shakes so that the batter covers the surface — the batter will still have a somewhat gelatinous texture and not be entirely free-flowing — and return the pan to the flame.",
    "Adjust the flame to medium-high (I use a medium setting of the largest burner on my gas stove). Bubbles should start appearing rather quickly on the surface of the lahoh, and they should mostly stay there as the lahoh’s top dries out. The lahoh should be on the flame for a total of 3 1/2 to 4 minutes, long enough for the entire top surface to cook and then some. If you smell the bottom of the lahoh burning, turn down the flame a bit. If the surface of the lahoh does not develop a nice amount of bubbles, try letting the batter sit for another 10-15 minutes before making the next lahoh.",
    "Remove the lahoh to a paper towel to cool — the paper towel absorbs excess moisture.",
    "Repeat the process, from the point where the pan is cooled under running water or in a bucket. There should be enough batter for a total of 6 lahoh.",
    "To store, the lahoh can be stacked with the bubbly sides facing each other and kept in a plastic bag in the fridge.",
