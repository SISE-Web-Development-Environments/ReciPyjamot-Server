  instructions: [
    "Clean carrots and dice them into long slices, leaving carrot pieces about 1/4 of an inch thick.",
    "Cut onions into half circles.",
    "Cut lamb into one inch cubes. I would suggest using iron cast oven. Preheat oil in the cast oven to very hot.",
    "Place meat into hot oil, cook until its brown on the outside.",
    "Add onions to the meat, cook until they are brown.",
    "Add carrots to cooking ingredients. Cook until they soften up just a bit.",
    "Add rice to the cooking ingredients. You should rinse rice a few times with cold water, it will get rid of the extra starch so the rice wouldn't stick together. Clean top layers of garlic.",
    "Cut off small part of the edges of cloves.",
    "Place garlic clove inside of the rice. Cover cooking ingredients with boiled water. The water should be just about 1 inch over the rice. Once it simmers, turn the heat down to very low. Cook for about 40-50 minutes.  About 20 minutes into cooking, turn over the top layer of rice, so it cooks consistently.",
